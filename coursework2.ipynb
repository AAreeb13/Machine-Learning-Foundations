This experiment was especially useful since bird and dog had the lowest accuracies previously and now we are able to identify them much better.

This would give a better idea of how how well the model performs in differentiating between classes."

This is expected because with larger epsilons, the perturbations to the image are larger and thus the image is more distorted. We can see that the graph is log-like in shape with a fast drop off in accuracy for small epsilons and then a slower decrease for larger epsilons. \n",
