To see this, suppose there is a k such that $\\sigma^{(k)}(x) = 0$, then intergrating k times would mean that $\\sigma$ is a polynomial of degree at most k-1, which is a contradiction. Thus for all n, there exists some b such that $\\sigma^{(n)}(b) \\neq 0$. Concluding the proof, we are allowed to divide by $\\sigma^{(n)}(b)$ in the earlier steps."
